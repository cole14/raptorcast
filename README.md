This is the repo for the O(N) reliable broadcast algorithm for the google coding competition.

The 'client' program will be a sort of file chatroom, where users will run the client, bootstrap their way into the broadcast group, then
broadcast files, or store files broadcasted by the group into files into the current working directory.
