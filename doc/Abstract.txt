Many modern computing applications, such as data warehousing,
distributed computing, and content streaming, require large
quantities of information to be broadcast rapidly over a
network.  Unfortunately these transmissions are not always
reliable, as hardware and software failures can cause messages
to be lost or corrupted.  In situations where fault tolerance is
essential, traditional broadcast algorithms guarantee
correctness by retransmitting data between all computers (peers)
in the network.  This method ensures that the message
will be delivered regardless of the number of peer failures
but at the cost that the total data transmitted grows as the square
of the number of peers.  This constraint, coupled with the
high cost of network bandwidth relative to processing power or
onsite storage, renders many potential applications
intractable.  We propose an alternative protocol called
RaptorCast, which leverages the properties of digital fountain
codes to achieve reliable broadcast with much lower bandwidth
usage.  In particular, by relaxing the strict fault tolerance
requirements of traditional algorithms, we can keep bandwidth
use linear in the total number of peers, while ensuring
correctness up to an arbitrary number of peer failures.  This
property, known as fault resilience is sufficient for many
internet applications, and could allow for organizations to replicate
mission-critical data across a large number of computers
for maximal information assurance, without sacrificing on-line system performance.
