A Linear-Bandwidth Reliable Broadcast Algorithm with 50% Fault
Tolerance: For a given set of N users, if any one user wants
to broadcast to the all other users, the traditional reliable
broadcast algorithm would start with the broadcaster sending
the data to each member of the set, and upon first reception,
each member of the set re-transmits the data to each user in
the set. This allows total fault tolerance, meaning that if
any one correct process delivers the message, then every
correct process will. The drawback is that this traditional
algorithm has a total bandwidth complexity of Θ(FN^2) where F
is the file size and N is the number of users in the set -
that's Θ(FN) per user, far too much if you ask us! Our data
broadcast algorithm takes advantage of the interchangeability
of the generated symbols of Raptor Codes to achieve Θ(FN)
total bandwidth complexity (Θ(F) per user) while maintaining
partial fault tolerance. This algorithm could allow
organizations to replicate mission-critical data across a
large number of geographically distributed backup locations
for maximum information assurance, without sacrificing on-line
system performance. It also lends itself to large-scale
media distribution applications.
